In my mind, not just this year but always I'm always the best. I'm always going to say that because I think we have to think we are the best in our area. So in my area I think I'm the best. Is there anything that Lionel Messi is better than you are? It's opinions. I respect the opinions. Maybe your opinion means better than me. But in my mind I'm better than him. Is that rival we are good things? For me rival than exists. The means of this world is not that exists. Rivals is in the war. We have rivals. In football now it's just a game. I think the numbers they say everything. I don't need to say arm. I'm an Easter off football, I'm a legend. The numbers say everything. This is I'm very comfortable.",

I try to do my things to improve myself in a training, specifically in games, because this is the most important thing. I always try to improve something season by season.

I push myself all the time to be the best. As I say many times in my opinion, I'm the best. I think we have to think like that. Not just in my job, but you have to think in your job. You are the best reporter. I'm thinking like that. If I'm not thinking like that, I'm not going to be stronger than I think I am. But you also love individual rules. I'm not a tea. It's part of my sacrifice, my obsession to win, to have success. When I say success, it's a work for that. Talent is not enough. I did it myself so much that this is part of me. Records is part of me. I don't follow the records. The records follow me, which is different. Are you addicted to winning? Yes, I am. I'm addicted to the success.",

Why is it always the case with you? I don't know, maybe it's someone who don't like me but because I'm maybe I'm too good. It is what it is. The life is completely difficult.
