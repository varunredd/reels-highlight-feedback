In my mind, not just this year but always I'm always the best. I'm always going to say that because I think we have to think we are the best in our area. So in my area I think I'm the best. Is there anything that Lionel Messi is better than you are? It's opinions. I respect the opinions. Maybe your opinion means better than me. But in my mind I'm better than him. Is that rival we are good things? For me rival than exists. The means of this world is not that exists. Rivals is in the war. We have rivals. In football now it's just a game. I think the numbers they say everything. I don't need to say arm. I'm an Easter off football, I'm a legend. The numbers say everything. This is I'm very comfortable.",

This is if it exists, it's my secret. The legend is one of these big names that stays forever in football history. But the guy wants to motivate himself with numbers, with new things. He wants to win the gold ball at times and the golden boots at times. And he wants to not just to play these heroes, he's already thinking that he wants to play the next World Cup. Does he get angry when people say maybe Messi is better? The time is few, it's... I don't think so. I just think that critics motivate him.
