In my mind, not just this year but always I'm always the best. I'm always going to say that because I think we have to think we are the best in our area. So in my area I think I'm the best. Is there anything that Lionel Messi is better than you are? It's opinions. I respect the opinions. Maybe your opinion means better than me. But in my mind I'm better than him. Is that rival we are good things? For me rival than exists. The means of this world is not that exists. Rivals is in the war. We have rivals. In football now it's just a game. I think the numbers they say everything. I don't need to say arm. I'm an Easter off football, I'm a legend. The numbers say everything. This is I'm very comfortable.",

The legend is one of these big names that stays forever in football history. But the guy wants to motivate himself with numbers, with new things. He wants to win the gold ball at times and the golden boots at times. And he wants to not just to play these heroes, he's already thinking that he wants to play the next World Cup. Does he get angry when people say maybe Messi is better? The time is few, it's... I don't think so. I just think that critics motivate him. I think he feels, if people criticize me, is because I am...",

I push myself all the time to be the best. As I say many times in my opinion, I'm the best. I think we have to think like that. Not just in my job, but you have to think in your job. You are the best reporter. I'm thinking like that. If I'm not thinking like that, I'm not going to be stronger than I think I am. But you also love individual rules. I'm not a tea. It's part of my sacrifice, my obsession to win, to have success. When I say success, it's a work for that. Talent is not enough. I did it myself so much that this is part of me. Records is part of me. I don't follow the records. The records follow me, which is different. Are you addicted to winning? Yes, I am. I'm addicted to the success.",

I think he feels, if people criticize me, is because I am... I did what I did and I still try to do when he gets that as an extra motivation. I think as an opponent, you should be quiet and don't say a wrong word about him because that would be always a motivation for him. I think he's the player that everybody knows, he is and mentally really very, very strong. Once again, as you say, it's Cristiano Ronaldo and it's controversy once again. Why is it always the case with you?",

The real bitch in Info Tafay was, so we scream and Chris, you know, what's so angry? He said he's cousin by your tennis table after two weeks he back and he beat Chris, he beat real in Info Tafay's whole history. So that's Christiano Ronaldo, he don't want to lose any game. Discipline is the most difficult thing, not only in sports but in life. I give you the map, you are willing to do that? Yeah, it's the main point because everyone wants to be Christiano but I give you the map, do you think you will do it that?",
